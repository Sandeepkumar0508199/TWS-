Thank you for your continued support in integrating with TWS. Based on recent discussions with our team , we have a few important clarifications we’re hoping to get your insights on:

TWS Trigger Mechanism

Can you please confirm how TWS triggers pipeline execution?
Is it event-based or schedule-based?

#Scenario-Based Clarification
1) Case: No File Received Initially
We understand that when a file is not available, TDR still triggers the pipeline and notifies TWS. TWS, in turn, runs the job and marks it as successful, 
even though the actual file was missing.

1.1)Later, when the missing file becomes available, the TDR job is retriggered and sends another notification to TWS.

Question:
In this case, where TWS already marked the earlier job as successful, how will TWS handle the second trigger?
Will TWS run the job again, even though it already succeeded earlier in the day?
Or does TWS have logic to ignore duplicate triggers or re-runs for the same job ID/date if it already succeeded?

We want to avoid duplicate processing of the same data. If TDR re-triggers the job later in the day when the file becomes available, 
we need to be sure that TWS does not reprocess it unnecessarily unless it’s explicitly intended.

Clarity on this behavior will help us document it correctly and avoid any re-processing or data duplication issues.

Looking forward to your guidance.
