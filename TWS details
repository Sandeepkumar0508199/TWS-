Hi TDR Team,
We have successfully set up the new TWS automated trigger for Master PL Two A to B pipeline. Since this is now working correctly, we need to discontinue the existing manual trigger process to avoid duplicate runs.
Please stop triggering PL Notify CCams - this will automatically stop the chain that triggers PL TDR Request and subsequently Master PL Two A to B.
Going forward, TWS will handle the pipeline triggering automatically after EBS job completion. Let me know once you've disabled the trigger from your end.
Thanks!

Database Configuration:

Verify our data tables are ready
Test stored procedures
Make sure alerts save properly

Security Implementation:

Set up secure connections
Manage passwords safely
Control who can access what

Testing & Validation:

Run tests to make sure everything works

What I Need to Get Started:

Azure access permissions
Database connections
Security approvals

Just checking — since the EBS job has already run today and was marked as successful (even though it failed in ADF), can TWS run it again today to test the updated failure scenario? Or will it skip re-running because the job already triggered once?
Hi [TDR Team / Name],

Quick question regarding the EBS job behavior:

What happens if there is no file received from upstream? Does the EBS job fail, show as completed, or stay in progress?

If a file is received but it has no data (empty file), will the EBS job still show as successful, and will it still trigger the analytics pipeline?

Just trying to understand how the job behaves in these scenarios for proper handling on our side. Let me know when you get a chance. Thanks!

How often does the EBS file get delayed?

Is it a frequent issue or only occasional?

By what time is the file typically received?

If the file is delayed and processed later in the day:

Will the TDR team inform us once it’s successfully processed?

Should we plan to manually rerun only the impacted T-1 analytics jobs (e.g., spoofing) afterward?

Does this approach sound reasonable to you?

If the EBS job hasn’t completed by 10:00 AM, we’ll go ahead and trigger the analytics pipeline manually.

Later, we’ll rerun only the impacted T-1 pipelines once the file is received and processed.

Let us know your thoughts. Thanks again!
