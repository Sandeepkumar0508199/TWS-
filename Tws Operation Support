Hey Venkat, quick clarification on the operations support side —

Who from the operations team is responsible for monitoring TWS jobs?

In case of a job failure, will the operations team handle the rerun, or will they just notify us (the dev team)?

Do they require any KT or documentation from our side to manage reruns and failures?

Are they fully onboarded and ready to support this flow in production?”
