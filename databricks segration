Subject: Request for High-Level Cost Analysis – COMS Monitoring Use Case in CPAD (EAI:12087)

Hi Matt,

Hope you're doing well.

I'm working with Harsha on onboarding the COMS monitoring use case into the existing CPAD Databricks workspace (EAI:12087). This use case focuses on evaluating LLM-generated output against COMS voice data, and we are utilizing the existing Databricks environment without provisioning new infrastructure.

Could you help with a high-level cost analysis to understand:

The impact of new components introduced for this use case

Any additional load this may place on existing shared resources (compute, storage, etc.)

Please let me know if you need further details or if someone else would be the right contact.

Thanks,

Stephen mentioned your name as the right person to reach out to for a high-level cost analysis, specifically to understand:

The cost impact of the new components introduced for this use case

Any additional load this may place on shared compute, storage, or other platform resources

Please let me know if you need more context or details.

Thanks,
Sandeep
